#### Important note: The game currently uses textures from Minecraft for ease of development but distribution with Minecraft's textures will not be happening. If a Mojang or Microsoft representative would like the Minecraft textures removed from the project immediately, simply open an issue in this repository and I will remove them as soon as I am available.
