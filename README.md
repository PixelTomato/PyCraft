# PyCraft
A two-dimensional sandbox game inspired by Minecraft and Terraria.

# Dependencies
| Name   | Minumum Version |
|--------|-----------------|
| Python | >= 3.10.0       |
| Numpy  | Latest          |
| Pygame | >= 2.0.0        |

#### Important note: The game currently uses textures from Minecraft for ease of development but distribution with Minecraft's textures will not be happening. If a Mojang or Microsoft representative would like the Minecraft textures removed from the project immediately, simply open an issue in this repository and I will remove them as soon as I am available.
